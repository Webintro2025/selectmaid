    "introduction": "Company registration is the foundational step in establishing a business as a legal entity in India. It legitimizes the business under the Companies Act, 2013, which is governed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). This process not only gives the business a distinct legal identity but also grants it various rights, responsibilities, and protections under Indian law. By registering a company, entrepreneurs can operate with greater credibility, attract investors, open corporate bank accounts, and enter into contracts in the company’s name. It also helps in protecting the personal assets of the owners by limiting their liability to the extent of their shareholding, in the case of private limited companies or limited liability partnerships (LLPs).",
    "definition": "Company registration is the formal process of incorporating a business as a recognized legal entity under Indian law. It involves filing the required incorporation documents, meeting statutory compliance requirements, and obtaining approval from the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Through registration, the business is granted a distinct legal identity, enabling it to operate, own property, enter into contracts, and be liable for its obligations independently from its owners. This process provides legal protection, ensures transparency, and facilitates smoother business operations. Depending on its structure—such as a Private Limited Company, Public Limited Company, One Person Company (OPC), or LLP—the registration requirements may vary.",
